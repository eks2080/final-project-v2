This project analyzes the median household income of New York City neighborhoods, overlaid with the zoning boundaries of the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program. Established in 2009, FRESH is a New York City-run program providing tax incentives and/or additional density bonus for developers to design and rent out retail space to grocery stores in newly built or renovated buildings. These incentives are only available in certain areas of the city with the highest need for supermarkets.

Broken down into six classes, viewers can explore median household income (2020) by neighborhood tabulation area, toggling the FRESH boundaries to understand patterns of where need and income overlap. Readers are also able to move between boroughs to gain a better understanding of income patterns and FRESH zones throughout the five boroughs. 

Additionally, readers can toggle the locations of three major grocery chains throughout the city: Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and Aldi. This provides an additional understanding of where these major grocers are choosing to locate within the city. For example, the most expensive of the three -Whole Foods- is predominately in highest income areas and largely outside of the FRESH boundaries. Viewers can look for patterns amongst these elements, allowing them to get a better understanding of the landscape of grocery access in New York City.
